Because every developer should do it at least once in his favourite language.

## Progress

* supersampling

After:

* * *

* textures on spheres

![11.1](progress/11/11.1.png)
![11.2](progress/11/11.2.png)

* * *

* introduced bilinear texture filtering

![10](progress/10/10.png)

* * *

* introduced textures over plane

![9](progress/9/9.png)

* * *

* introduced multiple light sources

![8.2](progress/8/8.2.png)
![8.1](progress/8/8.1.png)

* * *

* introduced plane as new shape

![7](progress/7/7.png)

* * *

* introduced light color
* introduced Phong specular reflection

![6](progress/6/6.png)

* * *

* calculating plane position according to camera direction

![5](progress/5/5.png)

* * *

* reflection of objects in respect of reflectiveness factor

![4](progress/4/4.png)

* * *

* shade casted between shapes

![3](progress/3/3.png)

* * *

* scene described by list of spheres and single light source
* diffused shade on shapes

![2](/progress/2/2.png)

* * *

* scene described by list of spheres
* adjustable camera position, fixed camera plan
* ambient light only
